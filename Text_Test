#INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.

Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!

Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

THREEPIO
We're doomed!

The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand.

THREEPIO
There'll be no escape for the Princess
this time.

Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.#
